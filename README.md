# Missing Error Handling in Express.js User Creation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling when processing user input. The `bug.js` file shows an example where a POST request to `/users` lacks robust checks for incomplete or malformed request bodies.  This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, including validation and proper responses for various error scenarios.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (assuming you have a suitable database setup).
3. Start the server using `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with a malformed or incomplete JSON payload to observe the error.
5. Repeat with `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
